What's this?
------------

This is a fork of Relan's excellent [fennecbuild repository](https://gitlab.com/relan/fennecbuild).
It allows compiling the entirety of Fenix without prebuilts along with removal of the proprietary blobs.

This fork is specifically for compiling Mull.
It enables many features upstreamed by the Tor Uplift project using preferences from the [arkenfox-user.js project](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).
It was originally created as builds of the patchset from [bug 1419581](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1419581).

This is compiled using fdroidserver.
You will need to copy the config files from -fdroiddata/ into their respective folders first.
Then run:
```
fdroid build us.spotco.fennec_dos:VERCODE
```
where VERCODE is a version code number.
VERCODE is currently prepended with 2 as an epoch for upgrade from old Fennec-based Mull.
The second to last number of the VERCODE corresponds to the architecture to compile.
0 = ARMv7, 1 = x86, 2 = AArch64

Setting up the VM
-----------------
Getting a working fdroidserver is a bit tricky.
Here are some steps to get you in the right direction.
- Setup a VM, you'll want at least 16GB RAM and 64GB of storage
- Fedora 34 and Debian 10 have been tested to work
- `git clone https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver.git`
- `git clone https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata.git`
- Install JDK 8 and 11, set 11 as default
- Put this in your path as your gradle, make sure the folder above it is writable for its cache:
```
wget https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidserver/-/raw/master/gradlew-fdroid -O gradle
```
- Disable the Gradle daemon to prevent OOM:
```
mkdir -p ~/.gradle && echo "org.gradle.daemon=false" >> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```
- setup Android SDK/NDK:
```
mkdir android android-ndk
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.3-linux.zip
unzip tools_r*-linux.zip -d android/
android update sdk --no-ui
android update sdk --no-ui --filter build-tools-30.0.2,android-30,build-tools-30.0.0-preview,build-tools-29.0.3,android-29,build-tools-28.0.3,android-28 --all
wget https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r21d-linux-x86_64.zip
unzip android-ndk-r21d-linux-x86_64.zip -d android-ndk/
echo "ndk_paths = { 'r21d': \"\$ANDROID_NDK\" }" >> fdroiddata/config.py
```
- Add the following to your .bashrc
```
export ANDROID_HOME=~/android
export ANDROID_NDK=~/android-ndk/android-ndk-r21d
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=$PATH:~/fdroidserver
```
- `source .bashrc`
- Fedora:
```
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```
